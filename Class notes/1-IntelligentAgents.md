# Lecture 1 - Intelligent Agents

### Concept 

Anything that can be viewed as **perceiving 
its environment through sensors** () and **acting upon that 
environment** through **actuators**.

- Sensors: cameras, infrared sensors, range finders, microphone, 
etc.
- Actuators: motors, wheels, speaker, etc.
- Agent = Architwcture + Program

## Intelligent Agents
- Rational Agents - The one who does the right/correct thing, a.k.a. one that makes agent more successfull(better peformance). \
↳ Given the percept sequence and agent’s built in knowledge \
↳ Rationality is distinct from omniscience

**Structures:**
AI task: Design the Program and Architecture for the 
Agent. \
Agents interact with environments through sensors and actuators, and the Internal Data Structures are updated using perceptions to make the decision of best action.

## The Nature of Environments: PEAS
- **PEAS**: Performance measure, Environment, Actuators, 
Sensors

The agent needs to know it's enviroment and task, therefore we must first specify the setting for intelligent agent design: Performance Measure, Environment, Actuators, Sensors.

ex: Agent - Taxi Driver Agent
- Performance measure: Safe, fast, legal, comfortable trip, maximize profits
- Environment: Roads, other traffic, pedestrians, customers
- Actuators: Steering wheel, accelerator, brake, signal, horn
- Sensors: Cameras, sonar, speedometer, GPS, odometer, engine sensors, keyboard

## Properties of Environments

## Intelligent Agents Architectures
### Simple Reflex Agents
### Agents with Representation of the World
### Objective-Based Agents
### Utility-Based Agents
### Learning Agents
### BDI Agents

## Multi-Agent Systems
