# 1.2 Missionaries and Cannibals Problem 
Three missionaries and three cannibals are on one of the banks of the river with a boat that only takes one or two people. The boat cannot travel the river alone. The goal is to find a way to get the six to the other bank of the river without ever leaving more cannibals than missionaries on one of the banks (even at the instant they leave/join the boat) during the process. 

## a) Formulate this problem as a search problem by defining the state representation, initial state, operators (their name, preconditions, effects, and cost), and objective test.

## b) What is the space state size for this problem? Represent it showing the possible objective states and display some of the possible transitions in the space state from the initial state.  

## c) Solve the problem, by hand, using tree search. 

## d) Using a programming language of your choice, solve the problem by applying: 
### (BFS) Breadth-first search strategy
### (DFS) Depth-first search strategy (limited depth);  
### (IDDFS) Iterative deepening strategy
